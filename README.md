# "Awesome" Android OEM issues (Common problems with specific Android device types from OEMs)

As Android developers, we struggle daily with the variety of OEMs, each coming with their own problems. Something that seems to work with most of the devices, may crash or behave in an unexpected way on a particular type of device. And usually we recognize this rather late, through unhappy clients. 

This repo is created to share the problems we encountered with specific devices, so that others can look up and be cautious about it before putting theirs app into production.
