# "Awesome" Android OEM issues (Common problems with specific Android device types from OEMs)

As Android developers, we struggle frequently with the variety of Original Equipment Manufacturers(OEMs). Besides their differences in hardware, many companies use their own software overlays on open source Android OS. For Android app developers, these variations lead to unexpected bugs. Something that seems to work with most of the devices, may crash or behave in an unexpected way on a particular brand or model. And usually we recognize this rather late, through unhappy clients.

This repository is created to share the problems we encountered with specific brands and models, so that others can look up and be cautious about it before putting their app into production. It will also provide some space for discussing possible solutions or workarounds to the problem with other developers. 

## Browsing OEM Issues

OEM issues are composed as GitHub discussions in this repository. You can directly go to the [discussions](https://github.com/OyaCanli/awesome-android-oem-issues/discussions) section of this repository and start browsing through the issues. You can filter by the categories on the left, and you can use the search box if you look for something specific.

We also have a website for browsing issues.  It provides a different overview, and we hope to improve it and add several filtering options in the future, for better insights. Thatâ€™s the reason we request developers to also contribute to the JSON file.
